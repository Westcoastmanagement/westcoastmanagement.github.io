        <h1 class="text-center">The Kiwifruit Seasons
        </h1>
        <p>Understanding the seasonality of the kiwifruit is important when applying to work at the kiwifruit industry.</p>
        <p>Depending on the season, the regular orchard worker will perform different tasks that require different skillsets from the applicant. The good news is that most employers understand that many of their workers are newcomers, who lack of experience within the Kiwifruit industry.</p>
        <p>For that reason, at West Coast Management Ltd, we ensure all new personnel who joins us receive top-notch training, to get them up and running to perform all necessary task at the orchard an make sure the work is performed in a technical and timely manner.</p>
        <p>The kiwifruit seasons can be split into three basic seasons, winter is when the plant is on a dormant stage. Summer is when the leaves start to appear, flower buds start to pop-out and the actual kiwifruit starts to grow. Kiwifruit picking happens when the fruits are still not yet ripe, so they can be harvested and dispatched to export, arriving ripe at the destination country.</p>
